<h1 align="center">Campfire: open-source, self-hosted deploy previews for containerized, headless frontends</h1>
<h2 align="center">All you need is a GitHub repo and an AWS account and to get up and running</h2>

Much like how an actual campfire brings people together to trade stories, Campfire aims to be a central place for cross-functional teams to visually review and comment on proposed code changes or bug fixes early in the development cycle.

Campfire creates a new deploy preview upon every pull request, creating a live version of the application incorporating the changes, all accessible via a shareable link. This live version is shipped with tools that allow users to provide feedback directly on the deploy preview. The goal is to simplify collaboration between teams and address common bottlenecks that delay project timelines, by integrating seamlessly into existing development pipelines.
